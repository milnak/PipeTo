# PIPETO

## Name

PIPETO - used in a pipe, to pipe the standard input to the
specified Windows executable.

## Description

`PIPETO [-tee] command-string`

## Examples

This command is usually used in a pipe, to pipe the standard input to the
specified Windows executable.  For example: `DIR | PIPETO NOTEPAD $$`

In this case, the output of the DIR command is used as input to the Windows
notepad.  The `$$` in the command is used as a placeholder for the
temporary file generated by PIPETO to hold the results of the standard
input.  It is needed only if the command needs its filename argument in the
middle of the command string; if the filename argument is at the end of the
command, the `$$` can be omitted.  Therefore, the above named example could
could also be written as `DIR | PIPETO NOTEPAD`

The optional argument `-tee` indicates that the standard input is to be
written to the standard output as well as to the specified command.  So the
command

`DIR | PIPETO -tee NOTEPAD | GREP FOO`

will output the results of "DIR" to the Notepad and will also pipe them to
the `GREP` command.
